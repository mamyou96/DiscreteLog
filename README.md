# DiscreteLog
In this project, I find an algorithm to compute discrete logarithm in Z<sup>*</sup><sub>p</sub>, when p is a prime number such that p = 2<sup>n</sup> + 1 for some n. More precisely, for a given prime number p, generator g and arbitrary y 2 Zp∗, we want to calculate x such that gx = y mod p. $x \in A$
Let x = bn−12n−1 + bn−22n−2 + ::: + b12 + b0 be the binary representation of x.
